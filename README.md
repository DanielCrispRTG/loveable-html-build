## âœ… **CAMERA AND QR FUNCTIONALITY NOW WORKING!**

The app now has fully functional camera capture and hash generation! ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸš€ Quick Test

To test the working camera functionality:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/loveable-html-build

# Test camera only
npm run camera-test

# Test full app with working camera
npm start
# OR launch from Applications folder

# Debug mode (if issues)
npm run debug
```

### ðŸ“± How to Use

1. **Launch App**: Open SnapHashQR from Applications or run `npm start`
2. **Navigate to Capture**: Click the "Capture" button in the top navigation
3. **Start Camera**: Click "ðŸ“¹ Start Camera" button
4. **Grant Permission**: Allow camera access when prompted
5. **Capture Photo**: Click "ðŸ“¸ Capture Photo" when camera is active
6. **View Results**: See your photo, hash, and verification data
7. **Verify Later**: Go to "Verify" section to check hashes against records

# SnapHashQR Desktop App

A Mac desktop application for secure image verification using blockchain technology, built with Electron.

## Features

- **Secure Image Capture**: Take photos with metadata collection
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Generate SHA-256 hashes for image verification
- **QR Code Generation**: Create QR codes for easy sharing and verification
- **Blockchain Verification**: Verify image authenticity against blockchain records
- **Native Mac Experience**: Built specifically for macOS with native menu integration

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanielCrispRTG/loveable-html-build.git
   cd loveable-html-build
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

### Running the App
```bash
npm start
```

### Development Mode (with logging)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building the App
```bash
npm run build-mac
```

This will create a `.app` file in the `dist` folder that you can distribute.

### ðŸŽ† **What's Working Right Now**

1. **Camera Access**: âœ… Full camera permission and access
2. **Photo Capture**: âœ… Take photos with metadata collection
3. **Hash Generation**: âœ… SHA-256 hashing with timestamp and device info
4. **Verification Records**: âœ… Local storage and verification history
5. **Navigation**: âœ… Smooth section switching
6. **UI/UX**: âœ… Beautiful interface with notifications and status updates

## Development Notes

The current version includes:
- Complete UI from the original HTML with desktop optimizations
- Full camera capture functionality using WebRTC APIs
- QR code scanning using the nimiq/qr-scanner library
- SHA-256 hash generation with image metadata
- QR code generation for verification sharing
- Local storage for verification records
- Multi-section navigation (Home, Capture, Verify)
- Native macOS menu bar integration
- Proper window management and security configuration

### Integrated Libraries:
1. **Camera Capture**: Based on jserodio/electrocam with enhancements
2. **QR Scanner**: nimiq/qr-scanner - lightweight, high-performance QR scanning
3. **Hash Generation**: Custom SHA-256 implementation with metadata
4. **QR Generation**: Custom QR code generation for verification data

### Current Functionality:
- **Capture Mode**: Access camera, capture photos, generate hashes, create QR codes
- **Verify Mode**: Scan QR codes or manually enter hashes for verification
- **Storage**: Local verification records with image previews
- **Security**: Cryptographic hashing with device metadata for authenticity
